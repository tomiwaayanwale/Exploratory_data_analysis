# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This section of the project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where we use various graphical and statistical techniques to explore and understand the dataset. The primary goal of this analysis is to uncover underlying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data that can inform further modeling and decision-making processes.

## Objectives

- Visualization: Use graphs and plots to visually explore the distribution, correlation, and other key aspects of the data.
- Statistical Tests: Apply statistical tests to validate hypotheses and understand the significance of observed patterns.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Visualization

We use various visualization techniques to explore the dataset:

- Histograms: To understand the distribution of individual variables.
- Box Plots: To identify outliers and understand the spread of the data.
  -Scatter Plots: To explore relationships between pairs of variables.
- Correlation Heatmaps: To visualize the correlation matrix and identify strongly correlated features.

### 2. Statistical Tests

We perform several statistical tests to validate hypotheses:

- T-tests: To compare the means of two groups and assess whether they are statistically different from each other.
- Chi-square Tests: To examine the association between categorical variables.
- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): To compare the means across multiple groups.
- Correlation Tests: To measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two continuous variables.

## How to Run

1. Environment Setup: Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, and `statsmodels`.
2. Data: Place the dataset in the `data` directory.
3. Run the Notebook: Execute the Jupyter notebook to perform the EDA. The notebook will generate all the visualizations and perform the statistical tests automatically.

## Results

The EDA uncovers important insights about the dataset, including:

- Distribution of Key Variables: Identifying whether the data is normally distributed or skewed.
- Relationships Between Variables: Highlighting any significant correlations or associations.
- Statistical Significance: Determining which relationships or differences in the data are statistically significant.

## Conclusion

The insights gained from this EDA will guide further analysis and modeling efforts. The visualizations and statistical tests provide a solid foundation for understanding the data and making informed decisions.
